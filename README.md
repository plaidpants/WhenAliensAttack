# WhenAliensAttack

This is a alien shooter type game for the oculus platform, originally designed for the Gear VR.

I thought I would create a virtual reality game and this is what I chose to make. I had played the Oculus VR concepts "360Â° Space Invaders" by Tomas Mariancik and "Retro Invaders VR" by Ben Librojo and was inspired by these games as well as the original space shooter but was frustrated that neither is playable on current VR platforms so I decided to make something myself in the Unity game engine and the Oculus Unity SDK.

The game is made for the GearVR but the PC version with the DK2 (v0.8.0) also works well except for the cables getting tangled up when you spin around in your chair. I may port to Google Cardboard and HTC Vive if I get a chance. It doesn't really work well on a non-virtual reality system though.

Please let me know what you think.

The game was submitted to Oculus and accepted but they will not publish it without permission from Taito/Square Enix.

You can reset the view with the X button and move around a little bit with the B button. I also implement some rudimentary controls with the touch-pad on the side of the GearVR but it really doesn't seem to work that well but at least you can try the game out if you don't have a game-pad handy.

The game makes use of creative commons licensed music from Clearside. Outer-space images and models were created with Blender, Space Engine and Spacescape. Moon terrain courtesy of Black Sun. Sound effects generated with Bfxr. Special thanks to Ben Tristem, Brice Fernandes & Michael Bridges for their Blender and Unity courses on Udemy. The Laser Defender class section from the Unity course was very useful in making this demo. The title was created using the free font Green Fuz from Larabie Fonts.

This game is not licensed by Taito or publisher Square Enix, I did contact them but they did not provide permission for Oculus to publish.
